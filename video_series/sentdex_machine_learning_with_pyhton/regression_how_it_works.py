We are starting the process of breaking down what linear regression is,
and then we will work up to writing a linear regression algorithm from
scratch in python code. Goal is to understand how and why linear regresison 
can be threaded and why it works with 'continuous' data.

'Best fit line' in y = mx + b. m=slope b=y-intercep. Equation for m:
[mean(x)*mean(y)-mean(x*y)]/[mean(x)^2 - mean(x^2)]
Equation for b:
mean(y) - m*mean(x)

This is only for 2D data.
