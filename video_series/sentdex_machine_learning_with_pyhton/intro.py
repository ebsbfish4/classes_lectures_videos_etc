# Machine learning defined as giving machines ability to learn without being explicitly
# being programmed to do so.

# Used to be very difficult to get machines that could do interesting machine learning,
# now the machinery has advanced so much that it is way more practical

# Things like scikitlearn can be used with almost no understanding. To push limits
# you need to do better obviously.
