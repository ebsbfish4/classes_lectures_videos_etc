# This will be some random stuff that just does not fit in basics.
# Goal of basics is more "making things work" as opposed to worrying
# about efficiency or scalability.
# Three trademarks of intermediate pyhton programming:
# 1. It is efficient and scales well.
# 2. Maintainability. How easy is it to read and understand? Are you
# writing your methods and classes well? You will get to the point where
# as the project grows you want to add things, and if this is not done well
# then this can become a nasty process.
# 3. Modularity. When you make something, can it be used for anything else?
# Make it as generalizable as you can.
# Efficiency and scalability is more of a knowledge thing (you need to know how)
# while maintainability and modularity is more of a mindset thing.
