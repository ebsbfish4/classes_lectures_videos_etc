; Uniformly structured code is a huge benefit both to yourself
; and to any other programmers that may end up working on or using
; the code.

; Because the design method itself is structured so that the function
; and data recipes are independent, functions can continue to make sense
; regardless of how many new data types we have.

; Designing new data definitions is important in most programs.
