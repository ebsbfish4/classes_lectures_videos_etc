Data Science Process
1. Data collection
2. Data Preparation
3. Explorative data analysis
4. Machine Learning
5. Visualization

K-nearest neighbors:
Uses similarity between examples
Assumption: Two similar examples should have same labels
Assume all examples are points in the d dimensional space
Uses standard Euclidean distance

Pros and cons of KNN?
Pros -
-- Simple to implement
-- Works well in practice
-- No model or assumptions
-- Extended easily to new examples
Cons -
-- Requires large space to store the entire dataset
-- Slow! O(n*d) (examples and features)
-- suffers from the curse of dimensionality

Beware of over and under fitting

Overfitting -
-- Reduce the number of features
-- Do a model selection
-- Use regularization
-- Do cross-validation
